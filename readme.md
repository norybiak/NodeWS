#NodeWS
This project is a small websocket server with client code. I built this to be used with my MIDI Piano app, so Server.js contains specific code for that, however, it can be used for anything that requires simple websocket.

Client.js is used on the client side and doesn't require node or any library.

Server.js is used with node.
